5/28/22:
- I apologize for the delay. I have experienced several issues and I cannot release anything for a minute. Reasons include, Cannot build an exe file from the source code.
I also am in the process of buying several new pieces of machinery, and I am also in the process of aquiring a new GPU, an Asus RTX 3060 12GB. Reasoning for buying this card are beyond simple explination.
I can, and most likely will give a projected release date for the program. However, please keep in mind I am a single dev, going through a hard time as it is.
I am also very busy only able to work on this one day out of the week. This will be an interesting process nonetheless, for the mean time...
Projected alpha release date: Sunday, July 3rd, 2022. Please remember this can be sooner and later, this is just an estimate!
Thank you all for your patience!
