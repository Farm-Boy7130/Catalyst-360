/*
On Thursday, 5/26/2022, Project code-name "Catalyst 360" began development, This program will be much more diverse unlike the other programs I have on my GitHub.
This program will feature a functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) and will be written in both C++ and C#. This will be a single dev program, with regular updates.
Currently my plans are to release a Public Alpha v1.0.0 for testing, It will not fully feature a GUI until the official Full release of the program. The above statement
is slightly misleading in this aspect, I apologize for that. However, I am a full time highschool student and an Entrepreneur and don't have all the time in the world.
I will answer any questions I am asked in my discord server for this Open-Alpha testing phase. Public Alpha Testing is projected to start within the next week.
Could be tomorrow, Could be 4 days from now. Regardless, Please be patient for bug fixes. With this out of the way, I will list the features for this program.

Features for v1.0.0:
- Full Metric and Imperial system support
- Displacement and Compression ratio Calculator
- Some Customization
- Open-Sourced

As of today, 5/26/22 I will be working on the first iteration of the program. Thank you for your patience!
